# EviHunter
This repository hosts the technical document of EviHunter, a static program analysis tool built to determine the location and type of evidentiary data in the file system of mobile devices.

  ## Documents
  - Source Methods: Represent the types of evidence, used in both the reported evidentiary data types and constructing the file paths.
  - Sink Methods: Inherited from existing tools such as [FlowDroid](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/FlowDroid), [DroidSafe](https://github.com/MIT-PAC/droidsafe-src).
  - Dynamic paths: The path tag <intent> is used whenever EviHunter cannot statically parse the exact data (string) from the ICC bundles.
